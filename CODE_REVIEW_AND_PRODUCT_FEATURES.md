## 3. Implementation Recommendations

Based on the code review, here are recommendations for improving the NextTechFusionGadgets platform:

### 3.1 Code Quality Improvements

#### Backend Enhancements
- **Standardize error handling**: Use asyncHandler consistently across all controllers
- **Complete implementation**: Enhance `updateProduct` and `deleteProduct` with the same level of detail as other functions
- **Optimize database queries**: Add additional indexes and query optimization
- **Enhance validation**: Implement more comprehensive input validation

```javascript
// Example of improved updateProduct function
const updateProduct = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  const productId = req.params.id;
  
  const product = await Product.findById(productId);
  
  if (!product) {
    return res.status(404).json({
      success: false,
      error: {
        type: 'RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND',
        message: 'Product not found',
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      }
    });
  }
  
  // Authorization check
  if (product.seller.toString() !== req.user._id.toString() && req.user.role !== 'admin') {
    return res.status(401).json({
      success: false,
      error: {
        type: 'UNAUTHORIZED',
        message: 'Not authorized to update this product',
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      }
    });
  }
  
  // Update product with validated data
  const updatedData = {
    name: req.body.name?.trim(),
    description: req.body.description?.trim(),
    price: req.body.price ? Number(req.body.price) : product.price,
    // Add other fields as needed
    updatedAt: new Date()
  };
  
  // Only update fields that are provided
  Object.keys(updatedData).forEach(key => {
    if (updatedData[key] === undefined) {
      delete updatedData[key];
    }
  });
  
  const updatedProduct = await Product.findByIdAndUpdate(
    productId,
    updatedData,
    { new: true, runValidators: true }
  ).populate('seller', 'name email');
  
  const processingTime = Date.now() - startTime;
  
  res.json({
    success: true,
    message: 'Product updated successfully',
    data: {
      product: updatedProduct,
      metadata: {
        processingTime,
        updatedAt: updatedProduct.updatedAt
      }
    },
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    correlationId: req.correlationId
  });
});
